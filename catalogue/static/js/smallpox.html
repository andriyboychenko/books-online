                 <h1>On Servlets and Async Servlets</h1>
                 <h5>By Fabio</h5>
                 <blockquote>
  <p><em>This is the first post, on this blog, by Fabio Tudone, who has recently joined our ranks at Parallel&nbsp;Universe</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span></em>, part of the Java <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EE</span></span> standard, has long been (since 1998, when the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">2.1</span></span> specification was officially released) an important building block of Java-based enterprise&nbsp;architectures.</p>

<p>It is an opinionated <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> to serve request/response protocols built around a few fundamental&nbsp;concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A compliant <em>container</em>, that is a dedicated runtime that is either a standalone server (more common in the past) or a library-based embedded runtime (more common nowadays). It can support hosting several web applications at once and segregating class-loading between them. It can also provide management features such as application deployment, start, stop, resources allocation, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">JNDI</span></span> naming contexts, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">JDBC</span></span> datasources with connection pooling, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> adapters, thread pooling and so on. It’s basically a centrally managed package of Java <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EE</span></span> features where it’s possible to drop compliant&nbsp;applications.</li>
  <li>One or more <em>servlets</em>, that is classes implementing the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/Servlet.html"><code>Servlet</code></a> interface, which is not specific to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> as the Servlet specification was designed for request/response protocols in general. Implementing the interface means dealing with servlet configuration information, which most containers already handle, so it’s far more common (and convenient) to extend abstract classes that are part of the specification such as <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/GenericServlet.html"><code>GenericServlet</code></a> or even <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html"><code>HttpServlet</code></a>. Apart from lifecycle management, the remaining methods to be implemented are <em>request handlers</em> that will be called by the container when requests come in, and they are supposed to serve them. They’ll do so by manipulating mutable request and response objects (standard interfaces too) that they receive as arguments from the container itself or by raising an exception if some unexpected condition happens, which the container will manage appropriately depending on how it’s been configured, for example by redirecting to a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">JSP</span></span> page. They can also include and delegate (part of) processing to an entirely new handling chain mapped to some different URLs through the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/RequestDispatcher.html"><code>RequestDispatcher</code></a>. This was meant as a mechanism to chain servlets and was is use mainly before filters were introduced in&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">2.3.</span></span></li>
  <li>One or more <em>filters</em>, which extend the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html"><code>Filter</code></a> interface and are similar to servlets except they support <em>chaining</em>, that is they are arranged in a sequence and can delegate (part of) request processing to the next filter in the chain, as well as perform post-processing when it finishes. A servlet is always located at the end of a filter&nbsp;chain.</li>
  <li><em>Setup information</em>, such as mapping of requests and filters to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> requests that can be provided in several ways, from <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span> descriptors to class annotations to actual initialisation&nbsp;code.</li>
  <li><em>Request-serving threads</em>: each request is served by a dedicated thread that will run the whole filter chain the request itself has been mapped to and will block on network I/O operations associated with the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> request and response, as well as any other thread-blocking call necessary to complete the request&nbsp;processing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dissecting-the-servlet-api">Dissecting the Servlet&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span></h2>

<p>If we were trying to characterize the long-lived Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span>, we could qualify it&nbsp;as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Definitely <em>object-oriented</em> as every concept involved, no matter how abstract, has been objectified and translated into an interface or a class. “Servlet”, “Filter”, “RequestDispatcher” are all examples of this modeling style. The only exception is the container itself, which is an ubiquitous actor behind the scenes but has no unique representation and is dealt with indirectly, either through explicit actors or secondary objects such as&nbsp;contexts.</li>
  <li>It is <em>(object-oriented) patterns-based</em> and we can identify <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">several many</a> of&nbsp;them.</li>
  <li>It has <em>state machine semantics</em>, it is <em>stateful</em> and it is <em>mutable</em> because, assuming the request handling process is in some state (which is the sum of all the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span>’s objectified actors’ state, including the container), there are operations that transition it into a new, partially inspectable and different state while other transitions are forbidden (e.g. forwarding a request after the response has been&nbsp;committed).</li>
  <li>It is <em>handler-based</em> as you, the developer, don’t ask for incoming requests when you feel comfortable doing so but they are pushed on your servlets, which you are forced to code as objectified request&nbsp;handlers.</li>
  <li>It is <em>low-level</em> as it doesn’t provide, for example, routing mechanisms nor it fosters specific paradigms such as&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">MVC.</span></span></li>
  <li>It was originally born <em>synchronous</em> as the handler is supposed to complete request processing within the calling computational context (stack) and not at all to defer&nbsp;it.</li>
  <li>It is explicitly <em>thread-based</em> as the specification states that the handler’s computational context is a servlet container thread. Synchronous and thread-based together mean basically that the servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> was originally designed to be <em>thread-blocking</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In sum it is a very complex and opinionated <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span>, although based on opinions that were very commonplace, and with a very long backward compatibility&nbsp;history.</p>

<h2 id="incidentally-clojures-ring-a-new-lucid-and-minimalistic-view-of-http-servers">Incidentally: Clojure’s Ring, a new lucid and minimalistic view of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span>&nbsp;servers</h2>

<p>Although Clojure community is very plural and there are plenty of very interesting choices in every area, the “de-facto” Clojure low-level, basic standard framework for the web is <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a>.</p>

<p>Given <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> is pretty much a stateless request-response protocol, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> request serving is naturally a domain that lends itself very well to a functional, input-output modeling style. In fact, Ring thinks of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> requests serving as a total of 3 functional entities with straightforward&nbsp;relationships:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>handler</em> is a function receiving as its only input a Clojure map with well-known key names and value types, representing the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> request, and producing as its output another Clojure map that must have a specific structure, representing the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> response (this is an over-simplification though, as Ring allows returning simpler data structures for&nbsp;convenience).</li>
  <li>A <em>middleware</em> is a function receiving a handler function and producing another handler function. A middleware is thus an higher-order function which is meant to enrich any handler’s logic in some specific way, such as intercepting and serving filesystem requests or enriching the request itself with multi-part pre-processing information, and it’s thus akin to Servlet filters, although made much simpler through functional programming ideas such as first-class functions. Please note that middlewares can be <em>chained</em> in a specific order by the straightforward means of functional composition, because what we get by applying a middleware to a handler is another handler, to which then several more middleware functions can be&nbsp;applied.</li>
  <li>An <em>adapter</em> is a function receiving as its main input a handler function and returning nothing. Its purpose is purely the side-effect of spawning some <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> server that will serve requests using the provided handler and is thus really an adapter to some pre-existing (or new) <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> server technology. Its functional interface is not standard as the inputs it can receive are very much technology-dependent, but a common pattern is for many adapters to receive as a first argument the handler and then an implementation-dependent options map (or other sequence) as a second one. Furthermore the most common options, such as listening interfaces and ports, tend to have the same key names in most&nbsp;adapters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ring is an opinionated <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> too and in some ways it doesn’t depart from popular concepts, for example it is still handler-based, although the idea of the adapter as just a function makes it very straightforward to use it as the embedded <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> “boundary” of an otherwise completely traditional application; plus it is synchronous, <a href="http://static.usenix.org/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/vonbehren/vonbehren_html/">which is good</a> as it makes for straightforward and maintainable code. Still it takes a joyfully fresh, lucid and minimalistic view on the subject, trying to remove incidental complexity altogether and to provide the least number of orthogonal concepts needed to deal concisely and effectively with the domain’s intrinsic complexity, leveraging functional programming ideas and dynamic language flexibility to this avail; this approach very much conforms to the spirit of the Clojure language&nbsp;itself.</p>

<p>Please note that Ring says nothing about execution contexts: it is perfectly ok for someone to implement an adapter for its blocking <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> based on lightweight <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/#fibers">fibers</a> rather than on heavyweight threads: this is exactly was <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/comsat/">Comsat</a> offers and Ring’s lucidity and minimalism has greatly simplified writing such an&nbsp;integration.</p>

<h2 id="servlet-30-async">Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">3.0</span></span>&nbsp;Async</h2>

<p>The Async addition to the servlet specification serves as an example of the fact that <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OOP</span></span> doesn’t necessarily simplify the complexities of stateful APIs; sometimes instead it only provides the dangerous illusion of doing so, by spreading state all over the table, splitting it and putting it in&nbsp;objects.</p>

<p>This illusion can actually worsen the situation as it can make us think that a seemingly very simple idea to evolve our stateful APIs can indeed work without unintended&nbsp;consequences.</p>

<p>The “simple” idea behind the Async feature in <a href="http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/servlet-3.0-fr-eval-oth-JSpec/servlet-3_0-final-spec.pdf">Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">3.0</span></span></a> is that of a <em>new request mode, the asynchronous one</em>. When the request is switched to async through the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#startAsync()">startAsync</a> method call, we are “simply” telling the container that whenever the request handling chain (filters and servlets) returns and its associated container thread completes, we’re not meaning at all that request processing has finished and thus the response shouldn’t be shipped back to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> client. Instead, it should be held back until some other execution context signals that request processing has indeed been completed, and it will do so through either a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/AsyncContext.html#complete()"><code>complete</code></a> or <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/AsyncContext.html#dispatch()"><code>dispatch</code></a> method call on the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/AsyncContext.html"><code>AsyncContext</code></a> object returned by the <code>startAsync</code>&nbsp;call.</p>

<p>Needless to say, there are several possible interactions of the async mode with the stateful moving parts of the pre-existing Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span>: we’re going to have a look at some of them&nbsp;next.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling-in-async-mode">Error handling in Async&nbsp;mode</h2>

<p><code>AsyncContext</code> offers the ability to register listeners about request handling progress and abnormal conditions but outside of the container’s thread we’ll be running in a self-managed execution context, so the container can’t catch and handle exceptions for&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>Instead <code>AsyncContext</code> does offer a new form of processing delegation that will transfer control back to a container-managed thread, which is the purpose of the <code>dispatch</code> method. By using it after setting the error condition (and any other relevant information) in request attributes and by checking the request’s <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getDispatcherType()">dispatcher type</a> we can verify we’re indeed handling an abnomal condition originated in an async processing flow and choose to re-throw the exception, this time being able to rely on the container’s ability to manage&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>This approach is a bit convoluted and it basically requires using a revamped flavour of forward/dispatch features previously deprecated, as a matter of fact, by filters. Yet it works and it is a able to mimic the error handling flow that would take place in a synchronous setting; it would certainly be interesting to measure how efficient it is&nbsp;though.</p>

<p>The servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> has also been offering a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#sendError(int)"><code>sendError</code></a> facility but as of today it is <a href="https://java.net/jira/browse/SERVLET_SPEC-117">unclear whether (and how) it is supposed to work in async mode</a> and this situation can easily result in <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=454022">open issues</a> even in most popular servlet containers such as Jetty and&nbsp;Tomcat.</p>

<h2 id="filters-in-async-mode">Filters in Async&nbsp;mode</h2>

<p>The Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">3.0</span></span> spec explicitly disallows running filter chaining in an execution context different from a container’s thread. This limitation means that the only the handler at the end of the request processing chain, that is a servlet, can put the request in async mode, while pre-processing filter logic can only execute in the container’s&nbsp;thread.</p>

<p>This is quite unfortunate as filters, since their introduction, have been used by many popular framework and application developers to carry out substantial amounts of request processing that could benefit from running in separate execution contexts, such as fibers, without blocking expensive container&nbsp;threads.</p>

<p>In fact there are <a href="https://github.com/circlespainter/servlet3-filter-async-test#servlet-3-filter-chain-async-mode-test">several open issues</a> in popular servlet containers about this&nbsp;limitation.</p>

<h2 id="servlet-31-async-http-io">Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">3.1</span></span>: Async <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span>&nbsp;I/O</h2>

<p>Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">3.0</span></span> enables detaching the container’s thread and the servlet’s handling code from the request processing completion, but I/O to read the request and write the response was still&nbsp;thread-blocking.</p>

<p><a href="http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/servlet-3_1-fr-eval-spec/servlet-3_1-final.pdf">Servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">3.1</span></span></a> adds <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/arungupta/entry/non_blocking_i_o_using">asynchronous I/O capabilities</a> to requests, provided they are already in asynchronous mode, through the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletInputStream.html#setReadListener(javax.servlet.ReadListener)"><code>setReadListener</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletOutputStream.html#setWriteListener(javax.servlet.WriteListener)"><code>setWriteListener</code></a>&nbsp;methods.</p>

<p>There a few shortcomings about this new set of&nbsp;APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At most one read and one write listener can be&nbsp;registered.</li>
  <li>The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> doesn’t enforce registering them only <em>after</em> the request has been put into asynchronous&nbsp;mode.</li>
  <li>The listener interfaces are brand-new and have, for example, nothing in common with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_I/O_%28Java%29"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">NIO</span></span> APIs</a>.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous APIs allow more efficient implementations but do so in the <a href="http://static.usenix.org/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/vonbehren/vonbehren_html/">wrong way</a>, that is by adopting a convoluted programming model rather than providing execution contexts more efficient than threads while keeping the extremely useful “blocking” abstraction. On the other hand <a href="http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2014/08/12/noasync/">asynchronous APIs can be turned very easily into both efficient and expressive <em>fiber-blocking</em> APIs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-status-quo-and-the-way-forward">The “status quo” and the way&nbsp;forward</h2>

<p>Many organisations with substantial structure have already invested a lot in servlet-based technology, and changing direction for them is a relevant cost that needs to be weighted against concrete&nbsp;benefits.</p>

<p>Some of them are happy with it and are not affected by existing shortcomings. As for others it is possible, and hopefully it will happen, that future servlet specifications will address them but the servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> is a big and complex one; it also it needs to retain some level of backward compatibility, so it is probably going to take some time for specification reviews to be released, let alone for servlet containers to implement them correctly, efficiently and&nbsp;reliably.</p>

<p>Of course alternatives to servlets exist, such as Ring, and some organisations can decide that the cost of moving to different APIs pays out for them in order to gain productivity and to allow building more maintainable code assets; this cost can often be lower for new implementations rather than for porting existing&nbsp;ones.</p>

<p>If the most felt shortcoming about servlet-based <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> in your organisation is either that of efficiency or that of the asynchronous programming model, a very viable and low cost alternative exists in <a href="http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/comsat/#servlets">Comsat</a>: it will allow you to still use straightforward blocking abstractions and the familiar servlet <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span> (as well as many other popular and standard ones in the web and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DB</span></span> areas) but with the level of efficiency provided by&nbsp;fibers.</p>
